# to-do-list

A To Do List that utilizes local storage to retain data after page refresh.

A drop down list on the left hand, can be toggled by pressing the list button on the left. There, you can add new tasks (through a modal) or add new projects through the "Project List" page.

Each project has it's own property that contains an array of tasks. The lists are displayed per project switch, and persists through page refresh.
